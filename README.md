# DSA210-Term-Project

## Project Proposal
The goal of this project is to explore the entirety of my Youtube data, which includes search history, watch history, subscriptions etc. Since I've been using the same account for most of my life, I will be able to visualize how my usage evolved over time, how my interests changed, what type of content I keep coming back to, how my watchtime changes during the year and more! Youtube is most probably the site I have spent the most time on in my life so I am genuinely curious about what I will uncover about my usage. I expect to see my usage drop significantly during school semesters, and content switch to school related topics, and during holidays, increase significantly with hobby related content consumption.

## Data and Data Collection
I will be using Google Takeout to collect my Youtube data. The downloaded data includes the following: channels, clips, comments, creator-demographics, history, kids,live chats, music (library and uploads), playlists, shopping, subscriptions, support issues ,video metadata ,videos. I will not be using all of this data, but having them will be useful if there arises a need for that data. The downloaded data will be in .csv and .json formats.
